Chai Spies\n\nThis is an addon plugin for the [chai](http://github.com/logicalparadox/chai) assertion library. It provides the\nmost basic function spy ability and tests. Though useful for small modules, you are probably going to want something\nmore robust. Check out [jack](http://github.com/vesln/jack) for a full featured mock/stub/spy assertion library for use with chai.\n\nThis library is primarily meant to serve as a starting point for anyone interested in developing chai plugins. If\ndeveloping a module, you are welcome to use this as a starting point. I also encourage the use of the compile\ntools to allow modules to work both in node.js and the browser.\n\n## Installation\n\n#### Node.js\n\nChai spies are available on npm.\n\n      $ npm install chai-spies\n\n#### Browser\n\nInclude `chai-spies.js` after including `chai.js`.\n\n```xml\n<script src=\"chai-spies.js\"></script>\n```\n\n## Plug In\n\nIf you are using `chai-spies` in the browser, there is nothing you need to do. It will detect `chai` in the global\nnamespace and automatically get used.\n\nIf you are using node, here is a useful bit.\n\n```js\nvar chai = require('chai')\n  , spies = require('chai-spies');\n\nchai.use(spies);\n\nvar should = chai.should()\n  , expect = chai.expect;\n```\n\n## Building for the Browser\n\nIf you are developing an addon for chai, one thing you might find useful is the contents of the `support` folder.\nThis directly contains everything that is needed to package all js files in a directory for browser use. Provided\nthere are no external dependencies, everything will be packaged and wrapped with a CommonJS `require` style loader\nby [folio](https://github.com/logicalparadox/folio), a small JS packaging tool. Please consult the comments in `support/compile.js`.\n\n## Chai Spies Api Reference\n\n### Creating Spies\n\nIn this module, a spy is either an empty function, or a wrapped named function.\nOnce chai has been extended, you can create a spy through chai's own interface.\n\n```js\nfunction original () {\n  // do something cool\n}\n\nvar spy = chai.spy(original);\n\n// then use in place of original\nee.on('some event', spy);\n\n// or use without original\nvar spy_again = chai.spy();\nee.on('some other event', spy_again);\n\n//or you can track object methods calls\nvar array = [ 1, 2, 3 ];\nchai.spy.on(array, 'push');\narray.push(5);\n\n//and you can reset the object calls\narray.push.reset();\n\n//or you can create spy object\nvar object = chai.spy.object([ 'push', 'pop' ]);\nobject.push(5);\n```\n\n### Assertions\n\n#### .spy\n\nAsserts that object is a spy.\n\n```js\nexpect(spy).to.be.spy;\nspy.should.be.spy;\n```\n\n#### .called\n\nAssert that a spy has been called. Negation passes through.\n\n```js\nexpect(spy).to.have.been.called();\nspy.should.have.been.called();\n```\n\nNote that `called` can be used as a chainable method.\n\n#### .with\n\nAssert that a spy has been called with a given argument.\n\n```js\nexpect(spy).to.have.been.called.with('foo');\nspy.should.have.been.called.with('foo');\n```\n\n#### .once\n\nAssert that a spy has been called exactly once.\n\n```js\nexpect(spy).to.have.been.called.once;\nexpect(spy).to.not.have.been.called.once;\nspy.should.have.been.called.once;\nspy.should.not.have.been.called.once;\n```\n\n#### .twice\n\nAssert that a spy has been called exactly twice.\n\n```js\nexpect(spy).to.have.been.called.twice;\nexpect(spy).to.not.have.been.called.twice;\nspy.should.have.been.called.twice;\nspy.should.not.have.been.called.twice;\n```\n\n#### .exactly(n)\n\nAssert that a spy has been called exactly `n` times.\n\n```js\nexpect(spy).to.have.been.called.exactly(3);\nexpect(spy).to.not.have.been.called.exactly(3);\nspy.should.have.been.called.exactly(3);\nspy.should.not.have.been.called.exactly(3);\n```\n\n#### .min(n) / .at.least(n)\n\nAssert that a spy has been called minimum of `n` times.\n\n```js\nexpect(spy).to.have.been.called.min(3);\nexpect(spy).to.not.have.been.called.at.least(3);\nspy.should.have.been.called.at.least(3);\nspy.should.not.have.been.called.min(3);\n```\n\n#### .max(n) / .at.most(n)\n\nAssert that a spy has been called maximum of `n` times.\n\n```js\nexpect(spy).to.have.been.called.max(3);\nexpect(spy).to.not.have.been.called.at.most(3);\nspy.should.have.been.called.at.most(3);\nspy.should.not.have.been.called.max(3);\n```\n#### .above(n) / .gt(n)\n\nAssert that a spy has been called more than `n` times.\n\n```js\nexpect(spy).to.have.been.called.above(3);\nexpect(spy).to.not.have.been.called.gt(3);\nspy.should.have.been.called.gt(3);\nspy.should.not.have.been.called.above(3);\n```\n\n#### .below(n) / .lt(n)\n\nAssert that a spy has been called fewer than `n` times.\n\n```js\nexpect(spy).to.have.been.called.below(3);\nexpect(spy).to.not.have.been.called.lt(3);\nspy.should.have.been.called.lt(3);\nspy.should.not.have.been.called.below(3);\n```\n\n## Tests\n\nTests are written using [mocha](http://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) in the BDD interface.\nNode tests can be executed using `make test`. Browser tests can be seen by opening `test/browser/index.html`.\n\n## Contributors\n\n project  : chai-spies\n repo age : 3 years, 2 months\n active   : 26 days\n commits  : 77\n files    : 12\n authors  :\n    48  Jake Luer         62.3%\n     7  Glenn Jorde       9.1%\n     4  Keith Cirkel      5.2%\n     3  =                 3.9%\n     3  Sergiy Stotskiy   3.9%\n     2  JamesMaroney      2.6%\n     2  PG Herveou        2.6%\n     2  Ryckes            2.6%\n     1  Veselin Todorov   1.3%\n     1  Steffen           1.3%\n     1  Daniel Walker     1.3%\n     1  Domenic Denicola  1.3%\n     1  Andre Jaenisch    1.3%\n     1  PG                1.3%\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Jake Luer <jake@alogicalparadox.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

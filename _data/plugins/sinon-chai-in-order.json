This can result in awkward, non-fluent assertions:\n\n```javascript\nvar spy = sinon.spy();\n[1, 2, 3].forEach(spy);\nexpect(spy.getCall(0).args[0]).to.equal(1);\nexpect(spy.getCall(1).args[0]).to.equal(2);\nexpect(spy.getCall(2).args[0]).to.equal(3);\n```\n\nUsing `sinon-chai-in-order`, you can say this instead:\n\n```javascript\nexpect(spy).inOrder.to.have.been.calledWith(1)\n                   .subsequently.calledWith(2)\n                   .subsequently.calledWith(3);\n```\n\n## Setup\nIn Node, just install using `npm`:\n```\n$ npm install sinon-chai-in-order\n```\n\nIn your tests, have Chai use the plugin. Make sure you also use `sinon-chai`, otherwise the nested assertions will not work.\n```javascript\nimport chai, {expect} from 'chai';\nimport sinonChai from 'sinon-chai';\nimport sinonChaiInOrder from 'sinon-chai-in-order';\n\nchai.use(sinonChai);\nchai.use(sinonChaiInOrder);\n```\n\nThis plugin is distributed in [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) format so you can use it everywhere. However, it is exported as an ES6 module. If using ES5, please use:\n```javascript\nchai.use(require('chai-react-element').default);\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Setup\n\nThis project uses Gulp for build and tests, and webpack-dev-server for running and debugging in-browser. To install the project, just run npm install.\n\nTo start the development environment, run npm start, or, if you have Gulp installed globally, gulp dev. This runs tests using Mocha and in addition starts webpack-dev-server on port 8080. To run the tests, use npm test (or gulp test).\n\n### Issues\n\nPlease open an issue on the project's GitHub repo for any problem you might find. Please refrain from creating pull requests before discussing your problem in an issue.\n\n### Pull Requests\n\nPlease try to develop your submission using Test-Driven Development. At the very least, make sure that your changes are well-covered with tests, and that your code is clean.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"electricmonk","email":"shai.yallin@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-03-10T13:37:20.826Z","created":"2015-12-12T09:27:41.438Z","0.0.1":"2015-12-12T09:27:41.438Z","0.1.0":"2016-03-10T13:37:20.826Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/electricmonk/sinon-chai-in-order#readme","keywords":["assertion","assert","chai","chai-plugin","sinon","spy","test"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/electricmonk/sinon-chai-in-order.git"},"author":{"name":"shai.yallin@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/electricmonk/sinon-chai-in-order/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}

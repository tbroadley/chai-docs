It will detect `chai` in the global\nnamespace and automagically get used.\n\nIf you are using node, here is a useful bit.\n\n```js\nvar chai = require('chai')\n  , factories = require('chai-factories');\n\nchai.use(factories);\n```\n\n## Building for the Browser\n\nIf you are developing an addon for chai, one thing you might find useful is the contents of the `support` folder.\nThis directly contains everything that is needed to package all js files in a directory for browser use. Provided\nthere are no external dependencies, everything will be packaged and wrapped with a CommonJS `require` style loader\nby [folio](https://github.com/logicalparadox/folio), a small JS packaging tool. Please consult the comments in `support/compile.js`.\n\n## Usage\n\n#### Register a factory\n\n```js\nchai.factory('person', { name: 'John Doe', age: 29 });\nchai.factory('cat', { name: 'Boo' });\n```\n#### Build from factory\n\n```js\nvar user = chai.factory('person');\nconsole.log(user);\n```\n\n#### Overwrite property\n\n```js\nchai.factory('cat', { cute: true, age: 4 });\nvar cat = chai.factory('cat', { cute: false });\n```\n\n#### Extend a factory\n\n```js\nvar cat = chai.factory('cat', { cute: true, age: 4 });\nchai.factory('tiger', cat.extend({ scary: true }));\n```\n\n## Tests\n\nTests are written using [mocha](http://github.com/visionmedia/mocha).\nNode tests can be executed using `make test`. Browser tests can be seen by opening `test/browser/index.html`.\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) Veselin Todorov <hi@vesln.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

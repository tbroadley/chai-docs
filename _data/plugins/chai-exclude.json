This plugin makes it easier to remove those properties before comparison.\n\nhttps://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/885\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install chai-exclude --only=dev\n```\n\n```bash\nyarn add chai-exclude --dev\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n#### Require\n\n```js\nconst chai = require('chai');\nconst chaiExclude = require('chai-exclude');\n\nchai.use(chaiExclude);\n```\n\n#### ES6 Import\n\n```js\nimport { use } from 'chai';\nimport chaiExclude from 'chai-exclude';\n\nuse(chaiExclude);\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\n```js\nimport { use } from 'chai';\nimport chaiExclude = require('chai-exclude');\n\nuse(chaiExclude);\n\n// The typings for chai-exclude are included with the package itself.\n```\n\n## Example\n\n### a) excluding\n\n1. Excluding a top level property from an object\n\n```js\nexpect({ a: 'a', b: 'b' }).excluding('a').to.deep.equal({ b: 'b' })\nexpect({ a: 'a', b: 'b' }).excluding('a').to.deep.equal({ a: 'z', b: 'b' })\n```\n\n2. Excluding multiple top level properties from an object\n\n```js\nconst obj = {\n  a: 'a',\n  b: 'b',\n  c: {\n    d: 'd',\n    e: 'e'\n  }\n}\n\nexpect(obj).excluding(['a', 'c']).to.deep.equal({ b: 'b' })\nexpect(obj).excluding(['a', 'c']).to.deep.equal({ a:'z', b: 'b' })\n```\n\n### b) excludingEvery\n\n1. Excluding every property in a deeply nested object\n\n```js\nconst actual = {\n  a: 'a',\n  b: 'b',\n  c: {\n    a: 'a',\n    b: {\n      a: 'a',\n      d: {\n        a: 'a',\n        b: 'b',\n        d: null\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  d: ['a', 'c']\n}\n\nconst expected = {\n  a: 'z',     // a is excluded from comparison\n  b: 'b',\n  c: {\n    b: {\n      d: {\n        b: 'b',\n        d: null\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  d: ['a', 'c']\n}\n\nexpect(actual).excludingEvery('a').to.deep.equal(expected)\n```\n\n2. Excluding multiple properties in a deeply nested object\n\n```js\nconst actual = {\n  a: 'a',\n  b: 'b',\n  c: {\n    a: 'a',\n    b: {\n      a: 'a',\n      d: {\n        a: 'a',\n        b: 'b',\n        d: null\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  d: ['a', 'c']\n}\n\nconst expected = {\n  b: 'b',\n  c: {\n    b: {\n      d: {      // d is not removed because it is an object\n        b: 'b'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nexpect(actual).excludingEvery(['a', 'd']).to.deep.equal(expected)\n```\n\n__Note: `excludingEvery` will not remove the property if it is an object in a deeply nested object.__\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome.

With Checkmark, you can be assured that the\nassertion was made.\n\n## Installation\n\nInclude Checkmark in the browser, as a CommonJS module, or through AMD.\n\n```html\n<!-- Browser -->\n<script src=\"chai.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"chai-checkmark.js\"></script>\n```\n```js\n// CommonJS\nvar chai = require(\"chai\"),\n    plugin = require(\"chai-checkmark\")\nchai.use(plugin)\n```\n```js\n// AMD\nrequire([\"chai\", \"chai-checkmark\"], function(chai, plugin) {\n    chai.use(plugin)\n})\n```\n\n## How to use\n\n```js\ndescribe(\"something\", function() {\n  it(\"should check two things\", function(next) {\n    expect(2).checks(next) // <-- pass in the callback\n\n    \"sync test\".should.be.a(\"string\").mark() // <-- check 1\n\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      // check 2, callback is called after the current event finishes\n      \"async test\".should.be.a(\"string\").mark()\n    }, 500)\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## API\n\nCheckmark builds on Chai's assertion library by adding just two methods:\n\n### `expect(Number).check(Function)` or `.checks(Function)`\n\nThis must be called before `.mark()` but doesn't have to be at the very\nbeginning of a test. You establish how many times you expect `.mark()` to\nbe called and optionally pass in a callback to be called when the number\nof marks is reached.\n\n### `expect(str).to.be.a(\"string\").mark()`\n\nAdd `.mark()` to the end of every assertion to which you want to have\ntracked by Checkmark. You can use any number of Chai's assertions,\nincluding `.and`, as long as you end your statement with `.mark()`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull Requests are welcome. They will only be merged if they are based off the\ntip of the [develop][] branch. Please rebase (don't merge!) your changes if\nyou are behind. To learn about why rebase is better than merge, check out [The\nCase for Git Rebase][rebase].\n\nIn short, to bring your Working Copy up to the tip of [develop][], you can use\nthe rebase feature: `git pull --rebase`.

It was forked from [`chai-jquery`](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-jquery),\nand modified to work with [`cheerio`](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio)\ninstead of jQuery.\n\nIn the following documentation, all links to `chai-jquery` point directly to the version\nthat `chai-cheerio` is based on.\n\n## Usage\n\nAs this is a port of `chai-jquery`, I recommend that you check out the original\nproject's [README](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-jquery/blob/e1c6697286274bc4c6170040c0f1a7742c8b5798/README.md)\nfor usage information.\n\nHere, I will highlight the differences in assertion capabilities between\n`chai-cheerio` and `chai-jquery`:\n\n1. `chai-cheerio` does not implement [`visible`](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-jquery/blob/e1c6697286274bc4c6170040c0f1a7742c8b5798/README.md#visible) and [`hidden`](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-jquery/blob/e1c6697286274bc4c6170040c0f1a7742c8b5798/README.md#hidden)\nassertions. This is due to [known limitations](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio/issues/362)\nin the upstream `cheerio` project. Feel free to suggest workarounds, or even better, submit PRs.\n2. `chai-cheerio` cannot identify an element by the original selector that was used\nto find it, which means that for `.exist` assertion errors, it will simply output\n`expected `**`element`**` to exist` or `expected `**`element`**` not to exist`, unlike\n`chai-jquery`, which outputs `expected `**`#foo`**` not to exist` to identify the element.\nThis is because `chai-jquery` makes use of jQuery's deprecated [`.selector`](https://api.jquery.com/selector/)\nproperty, while `cheerio` does not have this property. Again, feel free to\nsuggest workarounds or submit PRs.\n3. `chai-cheerio` does not implement the [`focus`](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-jquery/blob/e1c6697286274bc4c6170040c0f1a7742c8b5798/README.md#focus) assertion.\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo run the test suite, run `npm install` (requires\n[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to be installed on your system), and then:\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"merott","email":"npm@merott.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-03-02T13:39:28.804Z","created":"2016-03-02T13:39:28.804Z","1.0.0":"2016-03-02T13:39:28.804Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/Merott/chai-cheerio#readme","keywords":["chai","chai-plugin","vendor","dom","test","assertion","assert","testing","jQuery","Cheerio"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/Merott/chai-cheerio.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Merott/chai-cheerio/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}

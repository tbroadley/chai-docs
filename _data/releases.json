    "body": "# 4.0.0-canary.2 / 2017-04-17\r\n\r\nThe second release in the 4.0.0 canary release cycle. Around the end of April, barring any showstopper bugs, this will be released as `4.0.0`\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n - We've dropped support for Node 0.10 (See [#816](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/816)) and Node 0.12 ([#901](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/901)). The minimum supported version is now Node 4.0. If you wish to continue using older versions of Node with Chai, please continue to use the `3.5.0` release. Officially, version 4.0.0 of chai supports Nodes 4, 6, 7, as well as the moving LTS version (currently 6.10.2). We plan to support Node 4 until at-least April 2018 (inline with Node Foundation support).\r\n\r\n - `.not.keys` on its own is now the equivalent of `.not.all.keys` ([#924](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/924)). The docs mention this, and suggest to always pair `.keys` with something.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n - Added side-effectful \"register\" style scripts for each interface, (See [#868](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/868/files)). This allows one to `require('chai/should')` which will automatically call `global.should = chai.should()`. This is useful for users who wish to automatically get a global for their codebase. [Read the docs for more info](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/blob/4.0.0-canary.2/README.md#native-modules-usage-registers-the-chai-testing-style-globally)!\r\n\r\n - Added the `browser` field to the package json ([#875](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/875)). This will help with browser bundling tools.\r\n\r\n - Added `.own.include` and `.nested.include` ([#926](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/926)).\r\n\r\n - If you attempt to call `.throws` with something that isn't a constructor (like `TypeError`) you will now get a more helpful error message about this. (before it would say `Right-hand side of 'instanceof' is not an object`, now it says `The instanceof assertion needs a constructor but <type> was given`). ([#899](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/899/files)).\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n - Minor update deep-eql to 2.0.1 ([#871](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/871)) which fixes bugs around Memoization, and lets comparators override evaluation of primitives.\r\n\r\n - We've updated documentation and error handling around using `.length` ([#897](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/897)) - which can, in some cases, be problematic. Typically, you'll want to use `.lengthOf` instead - but the documentation now makes this clear, and errors are more helpful when bad things happen.\r\n\r\n - We've improved stack traces to strip out chai's internals, especially in newer environments which use Proxies ([#884](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/884) and [#922](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/922)). \r\n\r\n - We've gone through and made sure every assertion honors the custom error message you pass it - some didn't! ([#947](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/947)).\r\n\r\n - `getFuncName` has had an update since we pulled out the behaviour in `4.0.0-canary.1` ([#915](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/915)). Practically this doesn't change anything in Chai.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n - Added LICENSE file ([#854](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/854))\r\n - Major documentation rewrite including the plugin docs ([#911](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/911)), `.throw` docs ([#866](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/866)), and, well, just about all other docs ([#920](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/920)). These docs are far more detailed now, explaining caveats, algorithms and best practices.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "# 4.0.0-canary.1\n\n# Breaking Changes\n- Instead of allowing the user to write the path of a property, **now the deep flag performs a deep equality comparison when used with the `.property` assertion**.\n  If you want the old behavior of using the dot or bracket notation to denote the property you want to assert against **you can use the new `.nested` flag**. _(Related Issues: #745, #743, PRs: #758, #757)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  const obj = {a: 1};\n  \n  // The `.deep` flag now does deep equality comparisons\n  expect({foo: obj}).to.have.deep.property('foo', {a: 1});\n  \n  // Use the `nested` flag if you want to assert against a nested property using the bracket or dot notation\n  expect({foo: obj}).to.have.nested.property('foo.a', 1);\n  \n  // You can also use both flags combined\n  const obj2 = {a: {b: 2}};\n  expect({foo: obj2}).to.have.deep.nested.property('foo.a', {b: 2});\n  ```\n  \n  Please notice that the old methods which used the old behavior of the `deep` flag on the `assert` interface have been renamed. They all have had the `deep` word changed by the `nested` word. If you want to know more about this please take a look at #757.\n- Previously, `expect(obj).not.property(name, val)` would throw an Error if `obj` didn't have a property named `name`. This change causes the assertion to pass instead.\n  The `assert.propertyNotVal` and `assert.deepPropertyNotVal` assertions were renamed to `assert.notPropertyVal` and `assert.notDeepPropertyVal`, respectively. _(Related Issues: #16, #743, #758)_\n- You can now use the `deep` flag for the `.include` assertion in order to perform a `deep` equality check to see if something is included on the `target`.\n  Previously, `.include` was using strict equality (`===`) for non-negated property inclusion, but `deep` equality for negated property inclusion and array inclusion.\n  **This change causes the .include assertion to always use strict equality unless the deep flag is set.**\n  Please take a look [at this comment](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/743#issuecomment-235763477) if you want to know more about it.  _(Related Issues: #743, PRs: #760, #761)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  const obj = {a: 1};\n  expect([obj]).to.deep.include({a:1});\n  expect({foo: obj}).to.deep.include({foo: {a:1}});\n  ```\n- Fix unstable behavior of the `NaN` assertion. Now we use the suggested ES6 implementation.\n  The new implementation is now more correct, strict and simple. While the old one threw false positives, the new implementation only checks if something is `NaN` (or not if the `.not` flag is used) and nothing else. _(Related Issues: #498, #682, #681, PRs: #508)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  // Only `NaN` will be considered to be `NaN` and nothing else\n  expect(NaN).to.be.NaN;\n  \n  // Anything that is not `NaN` cannot be considered as `NaN`\n  expect('randomString').not.to.be.NaN;\n  expect(true).not.to.be.NaN;\n  expect({}).not.to.be.NaN;\n  expect(4).not.to.be.NaN;\n  ```\n- Throw when calling `_super`on `overwriteMethod`if the method being overwritten is `undefined`.\n  Currently if the method you are trying to overwrite is not defined and your new method calls `_super` it will throw an `Error`._(Related Issues: #467, PRs: #528)_\n  Before this change, calling `_super` would simply return `this`.\n  \n  ``` js\n  // Considering the method `imaginaryMethod` does not exist, this would throw an error for example:\n  chai.use(function (chai, utilities) {\n    chai.Assertion.overwriteMethod('imaginaryMethod', function (_super) {\n      return function () {\n        _super.apply(this, arguments);\n      }\n    });\n  });\n  \n  // This will throw an error since you are calling `_super` which should be a method (in this case, the overwritten assertion) that does not exist\n  expect('anything').to.imaginaryMethod(); \n  ```\n- Now `showDiff` is turned on by default whenever the `showDiff` flag is anything other than `false`.\n  This issue will mostly affect plugin creators or anyone that made extensions to the core, since this affects the `Assertion.assert` method. _(Related Issues: #574, PRs: #515)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  // Now whenever you call `Assertion.assert` with anything that is not false for the `showDiff` flag it will be true\n  // The assertion error that was thrown will have the `showDiff` flag turned on since it was not passed to the `assert` method\n  try {\n    new chai.Assertion().assert(\n        'one' === 'two'\n      , 'expected #{this} to equal #{exp}'\n      , 'expected #{this} to not equal #{act}'\n      , 'one'\n      , 'two'\n    );\n  } catch(e) {\n    assert.isTrue(e.showDiff);\n  }\n  \n  // The assertion error that was thrown will have the `showDiff` flag turned off since here we passed `false` explicitly\n  try {\n    new chai.Assertion().assert(\n        'one' === 'two'\n      , 'expected #{this} to equal #{exp}'\n      , 'expected #{this} to not equal #{act}'\n      , 'one'\n      , 'two'\n      , false\n    );\n  } catch(e) {\n    assert.isFalse(e.showDiff);\n  }\n  ```\n- The Typed Array types are now truncated if they're too long (in this case, if they exceed the `truncateThreshold` value on the `config`). _(Related Issues: #441, PRs: #576)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  var arr = [];\n  for (var i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {\n    arr.push(i);\n  }\n  \n  // The assertion below will truncate the diff shown and the enourmous typed array will be shown as:\n  // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...  ] instead of printing the whole typed array\n  chai.expect(new Float32Array(100)).to.equal(1);\n  ```\n- The assertions: `within`, `above`, `least`, `below`, `most`, `increase`, `decrease` will throw an error if the assertion's target or arguments are not numbers. _(Related Issues: #691, PRs: #692, #796)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  // These will throw errors, for example:\n  expect(null).to.be.within(0, 1);\n  expect(null).to.be.above(10);\n  expect(null).to.be.at.least(20);\n  expect(null).to.be.below(20);\n  expect(null).to.be.at.most(20);\n  expect(null).to.increase.by(20);\n  expect(null).to.decrease.by(20);\n  \n  // This will not:\n  expect('string').to.have.a.length.of.at.least(3);\n  ```\n- Previously, expect(obj).not.ownProperty(name, val) would throw an Error if obj didn't have an own property (non-inherited) named name. This change causes the assertion to pass instead. (Related Issues: #795, #, PRs: #744, #810)*\n  \n  ``` js\n  expect({ foo: 'baz' }).to.not.have.own.property('quux', 'baz');\n  ```\n- The `.empty` assertion will now throw when it is passed non-string primitives and functions _(PRs: #763, #812)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  // These will throw TypeErrors:\n  expect(Symbol()).to.be.empty;\n  expect(function() {}).to.be.empty;\n  expect(true).to.be.empty;\n  expect(1).to.be.empty\n  ```\n- Assertion subject (`obj`) changes when using `ownProperty` or `own.property` and thus enables chaining. _(Related Issues: #281, PRs: #641)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  expect({val: 20}).to.have.own.property('val').above(10);\n  ```\n- The `utils` (second argument passed to the `chai.use` callback function) no longer exports the `getPathValue` function. If you want to use that please use the [`pathval`](https://github.com/chaijs/pathval) module, which is what chai uses internally now. _(Related Issues: #457, #737, PRs: #830)_\n\n# New Features\n- Throw when non-existent property is read. _(Related Issues: #407, #766 PRs: #721, #770)_\n  **This is a potentially breaking change. Your build will fail if you have typos in your property assertions**\n  Before `4.x.x` when using property assertions they would not throw an error if you wrote it incorrectly.\n  The example below, for example, would pass:\n  \n  ``` js\n  expect(true).to.be.ture; // Oops, typo, now Chai will throw an Error\n  ```\n  \n  Since this implementation depends on ES6 `Proxies` it will only work on platforms that support it.\n  \n  **This property can be enabled (default) or disabled through the `config.useProxy` property**, for example:\n  \n  ``` js\n  chai.config.useProxy = false;  // disable use of Proxy\n  ```\n- Add fix suggestions when accessing a nonexistent property in proxy mode. _(Related Issues: #771, PRs: #782)_\n  When a nonexistent property is accessed in proxy mode, Chai will compute [the levenshtein distance](http://www.levenshtein.net) to all possible properties in order to suggest the best fix to the user.\n  \n  ``` js\n  expect(false).to.be.fals; // Error: Invalid Chai property: fals. Did you mean \"false\"?\n  expect('foo').to.be.undefind; // Error: Invalid Chai property: undefind. Did you mean \"undefined\"?\n  \n  // If the Levenshtein distance between the word and any Chai property is greater than 4, no fix will be suggested\n  expect('foo').to.be.fdsakfdsafsagsadgagsdfasf // error thrown, no fix suggested\n  ```\n- When non-chainable methods (including overwritten non-chainable methods) are used incorrectly an error will be thrown with a helpful error message. _(PRs: #789)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  expect(true).to.equal.true;  // Invalid Chai property: equal.true. See docs for proper usage of \"equal\".\n  ```\n- Add a new configuration setting that describes which keys will be ignored when checking for non-existing properties on an assertion before throwing an error.\n  Since this implementation depends on ES6 `Proxies` it will only work on platforms that support it. Also, if you disable `config.useProxy`, this setting will have no effect. *(Related Issues: #765, PRs: #774)\n  \n  ``` js\n  chai.config.proxyExcludedKeys.push('nonExistingProp');\n  \n  expect('my string').to.nonExistingProp; // This won't throw an error now\n  ```\n- Add script that registers should as a side-effect. _(Related Issues: #594, #693 PRs: #604)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  // You can now write:\n  import 'chai/should';\n  \n  // as opposed to:\n  import {should} from 'chai';\n  should();\n  ```\n  \n  You can also register should via a `mocha` option: `mocha --require chai/should`.\n- The `change` assertion accepts a function as object. _(Related Issues: #544, PRs: #607)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  // Now you can also check if the return value of a function changes, for example\n  assert.increases(\n    someOperation,\n    () => getSomething().length\n  )\n  ```\n-  You can also assert for a delta using the `by` assertion alongside the `change`, `increase` and `decrease` assertions. _(Related Issues: #339, PRs: #621)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  // You can use `.by` to assert the amount you want something to change\n  var obj = { val: 10 };\n  var increaseByTwo = function() { obj.val += 2 };\n  var decreaseByTwo = function() { obj.val -= 2 };\n  var increaseByThree = function() { obj.val += 3 };\n  \n  expect(increaseByThree).to.change(obj, 'val').by(3);\n  expect(increaseByTwo).to.increase(obj, 'val').by(2);\n  expect(decreaseByTwo).to.decrease(obj, 'val').by(2);\n  \n  // Please notice that if you want to assert something did change but not by some amount you need to use `.not` **after** the `change` related assertion\n  // Take a look at the examples below:\n  expect(increaseByThree).to.change(obj, 'val').but.not.by(5)\n  expect(increaseByTwo).to.increase(obj, 'val').but.not.by(1)\n  expect(decreaseByTwo).to.decrease(obj, 'val').but.not.by(1)\n  ```\n-  The `.keys` assertion can now operate on `map`s and `set`s. _(Related Issues: #632, PRs: #633, #668)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  // The `.keys` assertion now works on `map`s and `set`s natively, like the examples below:\n  expect(new Map([[{objKey: 'value'}, 'value'], [1, 2]])).to.contain.key({objKey: 'value'});\n  expect(new Map([[{objKey: 'value'}, 'value'], [1, 2]])).to.contain.any.keys([{objKey: 'value'}, {anotherKey: 'anotherValue'}]);\n  expect(new Map([['firstKey', 'firstValue'], [1, 2]])).to.contain.all.keys('firstKey', 1);\n  expect(new Set([['foo', 'bar'], ['example', 1]])).to.have.any.keys('foo');\n  \n  // You can also use `.deep` when asserting agains `Map`s and `Set`s\n  expect(new Map([[{objKey: 'value'}, 'value'], [1, 2]])).to.contain.any.deep.keys([{objKey: 'value'}, {anotherKey: 'anotherValue'}]);\n  expect(new Map([['firstKey', 'firstValue'], [1, 2]])).to.contain.all.deep.keys('firstKey', 1);\n  expect(new Set([['foo', 'bar'], ['example', 1]])).to.have.any.deep.keys('foo');\n  ```\n- Add compatibility with strict mode. _(Related Issues: #578, PRs: #665)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  // This means you can now run your code with the `--use_strict` flag on Node\n  // If want to understand more about this please read the issue related to this change\n  ```\n- Add `does` and `but` as new no-op assertion. _(Related Issues: #700, #339 PRs: #621, #701)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  // You can now write assertions forming phrases with these two new words:\n  expect(increaseByThree).to.change(obj, 'val').but.not.by(5);\n  expect(foobar).to.have.property(\"baz\").which.does.not.have.property(\"thing\");\n  ```\n- Allow `use` to be imported using new ES6 module syntax. _(Related Issues: #718, PRs: #724)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  // You can now import `use` using the ES6 module syntax, like the example below:\n  import sinonChai from \"sinon-chai\";\n  import {expect, use} from \"chai\";\n  \n  use(sinonChai);\n  ```\n  \n  You can also use `require` alongside the new ES6 destructuring feature:\n  \n  ``` js\n  const sinonChai = require('sinon-chai');\n  const {expect, use} = require(\"chai\");\n  \n  use(sinonChai);\n  ```\n- Add ordered flag for members assertion. _(Related Issues: #717, PRs: #728)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  // You can now use the `ordered` flag to assert the order of elements when using the `members` assertion:\n  expect([1, 2, 3]).to.include.ordered.members([1, 2]); // This passes\n  expect([1, 2, 3]).to.include.ordered.members([2, 3]); // This will fail! Read the docs to know more.\n  ```\n- Add `.own` flag to `.property` assertion. It does the same thing as `.ownProperty` and cannot be used alongisde the new `.nested` flag. _(Related Issues: #795, PRs: #810)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  expect({a: 1}).to.have.own.property('a');\n  \n  // The example below will thrown an Error\n  expect({a: {b: 1}}).to.have.own.nested.property('a.b', 1);\n  ```\n- Add `.deep` support to `.property` assertion. _(Related Issues: #795, PRs: #810)_\n  \n  ``` js\n  expect({ foo: { bar: 'baz' } }).to.have.deep.own.property('foo', { bar: 'baz' });\n  expect({ foo: { bar: { baz: 'quux' } } }).to.have.deep.nested.property('foo.bar', { baz: 'quux' });\n  ```\n- The `.empty` assertion will now work with ES6 collections _(PRs: #763, #812, #814)_\n  Please notice that this assertion will throw an error when it is passed a `WeakMap` or `WeakSet`.\n  \n  ``` js\n  expect(new Set()).to.be.empty;\n  expect(new Map()).to.be.empty;\n  \n  // The examples below will throw a TypeError:\n  expect(new WeakSet()).to.be.empty;\n  expect(new WeakMap()).to.be.empty;\n  ```\n\n# Bug Fixes\n- Fix missing msg argument for change related assertions. _(Related Issues: None, PRs: #606)_\n- The addMethod function returns a new assertion with flags copied over instead of `this`. _(Related Issues: #562, #684, #723, PRs: #642, #660)_\n- Fix stacktraces for overwritten properties and methods. _(Related Issues: #659, #661)_\n- Fix bug when testing Symbol equality with should syntax. _(Related Issues: #669, PRs: #672)_\n- Fix bug when asserting some valid ES6 keys. _(Related Issues: #674, PRs: #676)_\n- Fix bug caused when custom inspect method is used and this method calls stylize. _(PRs: #680)_\n- Fix ownProperty on objects with no prototype. _(Related Issues: #688, PRs: #689)_\n- Fix swapped expected and actual results for the `.members` assertion. _(Related Issues: #511, PRs: #702)_\n- Fix `same.members` to properly handle duplicates by treating each one as a unique member. _(Related Issues: #590, PRs: #739)_\n- Fix deep.have.same.members() that was not printing a diff. _(PRs: #509)_\n- Diff will be shown for assert's equal and notEqual methods. _(Related Issues: #790, PRs: #794)_\n- The `overwriteMethod`, `overwriteProperty`, `addChainableMethod`, `overwriteChainableMethod` functions will return new assertion with flags copied over instead of this. _(Related Issues: #562, #642, #791, PRs: #799)_\n"

Key points:\n- Feature: New assertion: `expect(1).oneOf([1,2,3])` - for asserting that a given value is one of a set.\n- Feature: `.include()` (and variants) will now give better error messages for bad object types. Before `expect(undefined).to.include(1)` would say \"expected undefined to include 1\", now says \"object tested must be an array, an object, or a string but undefined given\"\n- Feature: `.throw()` (and variants) can now better determine the Error types, for example `expect(foo).to.throw(node_assert.AssertionError)` now works.\n- Feature: `.closeTo` is now aliased as `.approximately`\n- BugFix: `.empty` changes from 3.3.0 have been reverted, as they caused breaking changes to arrays which manually set keys.\n\n### Community Contributions\n\n#### Code Features & Fixes\n- [#503](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/503) Checking that argument given to expect is of the right type when using with include.

    "body": "# 4.0.0\r\n\r\n4.0 has been a huge undertaking by the chai community! A lot has changed to ensure Chai 4 is a stable, reliable, well documented codebase. Here are just some of the major improvements:\r\n\r\n - almost all documentation has been rewritten, with detailed instructions on how assertions work, which flags they can be combined with and the best practices for how to use them.\r\n\r\n - deep equality has been rewritten from the ground up to support ES6 types like `Map` and `Set`, and better support existing types. It is now also much, much faster than before and allows us to bring some great improvements in upcoming releases.\r\n\r\n - we have made sure the `deep` flag now _only ever does deep equality_. Beforehand, it would sometimes also be used to test nested properties (for example `expect(foo).to.have.deep.property('bar.baz')`. For nested assertions, please now use the `.nested` flag.\r\n\r\n - many assertions have become more strict, which means you get better error messages explaining where things have gone wrong. For the most part, this wont mean error messages where there weren't error messages before, but it will mean better error messages to replace the, sometimes cryptic, default `TypeError` messages.\r\n\r\n - we've added detections and helpful error messages for common mistakes and typos. The error messages will, in some cases, point you to documentation or in other cases suggest alternatives. These messages will continue to be improved in future releases, so let us know if you have any suggestions!\r\n\r\n# Breaking Changes\r\n- We no longer support Node v0.10 and v0.12 (since their LTS has ended) _(PRs: #816, #901)_\r\n- Instead of allowing the user to write the path of a property, **now the deep flag performs a deep equality comparison when used with the `.property` assertion**.\r\n  If you want the old behavior of using the dot or bracket notation to denote the property you want to assert against **you can use the new `.nested` flag**. _(Related Issues: #745, #743, PRs: #758, #757)_\r\n\r\n  ``` js\r\n  const obj = {a: 1};\r\n\r\n  // The `.deep` flag now does deep equality comparisons\r\n  expect({foo: obj}).to.have.deep.property('foo', {a: 1});\r\n\r\n  // Use the `nested` flag if you want to assert against a nested property using the bracket or dot notation\r\n  expect({foo: obj}).to.have.nested.property('foo.a', 1);\r\n\r\n  // You can also use both flags combined\r\n  const obj2 = {a: {b: 2}};\r\n  expect({foo: obj2}).to.have.deep.nested.property('foo.a', {b: 2});\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Please notice that the old methods which used the old behavior of the `deep` flag on the `assert` interface have been renamed. They all have had the `deep` word changed by the `nested` word. If you want to know more about this please take a look at #757.\r\n\r\n- Previously, `expect(obj).not.property(name, val)` would throw an Error if `obj` didn't have a property named `name`. This change causes the assertion to pass instead.\r\n  The `assert.propertyNotVal` and `assert.deepPropertyNotVal` assertions were renamed to `assert.notPropertyVal` and `assert.notDeepPropertyVal`, respectively. _(Related Issues: #16, #743, #758)_\r\n\r\n- You can now use the `deep` flag for the `.include` assertion in order to perform a `deep` equality check to see if something is included on the `target`.\r\n  Previously, `.include` was using strict equality (`===`) for non-negated property inclusion, but `deep` equality for negated property inclusion and array inclusion.\r\n  **This change causes the .include assertion to always use strict equality unless the deep flag is set.**\r\n  Please take a look [at this comment](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/743#issuecomment-235763477) if you want to know more about it.  _(Related Issues: #743, PRs: #760, #761)_\r\n\r\n  ``` js\r\n  const obj = {a: 1};\r\n  expect([obj]).to.deep.include({a:1});\r\n  expect({foo: obj}).to.deep.include({foo: {a:1}});\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Fix unstable behavior of the `NaN` assertion. Now we use the suggested ES6 implementation.\r\n  The new implementation is now more correct, strict and simple. While the old one threw false positives, the new implementation only checks if something is `NaN` (or not if the `.not` flag is used) and nothing else. _(Related Issues: #498, #682, #681, PRs: #508)_\r\n\r\n  ``` js\r\n  // Only `NaN` will be considered to be `NaN` and nothing else\r\n  expect(NaN).to.be.NaN;\r\n\r\n  // Anything that is not `NaN` cannot be considered as `NaN`\r\n  expect('randomString').not.to.be.NaN;\r\n  expect(true).not.to.be.NaN;\r\n  expect({}).not.to.be.NaN;\r\n  expect(4).not.to.be.NaN;\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- The Typed Array types are now truncated if they're too long (in this case, if they exceed the `truncateThreshold` value on the `config`). _(Related Issues: #441, PRs: #576)_\r\n\r\n  ``` js\r\n  var arr = [];\r\n  for (var i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {\r\n    arr.push(i);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // The assertion below will truncate the diff shown and the enormous typed array will be shown as:\r\n  // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...  ] instead of printing the whole typed array\r\n  chai.expect(new Float32Array(100)).to.equal(1);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- The assertions: `within`, `above`, `least`, `below`, `most`, `increase`, `decrease` will throw an error if the assertion's target or arguments are not numbers. _(Related Issues: #691, PRs: #692, #796)_\r\n\r\n  ``` js\r\n  // These will throw errors, for example:\r\n  expect(null).to.be.within(0, 1);\r\n  expect(null).to.be.above(10);\r\n  expect(null).to.be.at.least(20);\r\n  expect(null).to.be.below(20);\r\n  expect(null).to.be.at.most(20);\r\n  expect(null).to.increase.by(20);\r\n  expect(null).to.decrease.by(20);\r\n\r\n  // This will not:\r\n  expect('string').to.have.a.lengthOf.at.least(3);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Previously, `expect(obj).not.ownProperty(name, val)` would throw an Error if obj didn't have an own property (non-inherited) named name.

They don't have any chaining behavior, and there's no generic semantic benefit to chaining them. _(Related Issues: #917, PRs: #925)_\r\n\r\n```\r\n// This will not work anymore because there is no benefit to chaining these assertions:\r\nexpect(function() {}).to.change.by(2)\r\nexpect(function() {}).to.increase.by(2)\r\nexpect(function() {}).to.decrease.by(2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The `utils` (second argument passed to the `chai.use` callback function) no longer exports the `getPathValue` function.

If\n  you're using RequireJS with Chai, you might notice a change (chai used to\n  be a global, now it won't be - instead you'll have to `require` it).\n- `.has.property('foo', undefined)` will now specifically test to make sure\n  that the value `'foo'` is actually undefined - before it simply tested that\n  the key existed (but could have a value).\n- `.to.be.a('type')` has changed to support more types, including ES6 types\n  such as `'promise'`, `'symbol'`, `'float32array'` etc, this also means using\n  ES6's `Symbol.toStringTag` affects the behaviour `.to.be.a()`. In addition to\n  this, Errors have the type of `'error'`.\n- `assert.ifError()` now follows Node's `assert.ifError()` behaviour - in other\n  words, if the first argument is truthy, it'll throw it.\n- ReleaseNotes.md is no longer maintained, see the [Github Releases Page](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/releases) instead.\n- History.md is no longer maintained, see the [Github Commit Log](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/commits/master) instead.\n\n### Community Contributions\n\n#### Code Features & Fixes\n- [#403](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/403) `assert.ifError()` behaves like Node.js: it throws if the first argument is present.\n  By [@cjqed](https://github.com/cjqed)\n- [#419](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/419) [assertion-error](https://github.com/chaijs/assertion-error) bumped to `^1.0.1`\n  By [@keithamus](https://github.com/keithamus) (special thanks to [@simonzack](https://github.com/simonzack) for his work on assertion-error)\n- [#421](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/421) replace type.js with type-detect module.\n  By [@Charminbear](https://github.com/Charminbear)\n- [#439](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/439) Add `.matches()` as alias for `.match()`.\n  By [@thejameskyle](https://github.com/thejameskyle)\n- [#451](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/451) Switch to using Browserify for the build system.\n  By [@csnover](https://github.com/csnover)\n- [#452](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/452) `.property('foo', undefined)` now actually checks to see if `obj.foo === undefined` (before it did not).\n  By [@onefifth](https://github.com/onefifth)\n- [#460](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/460) Automate release process as much as possible\n  By [@keithamus](https://github.com/keithamus)\n\n#### Documentation fixes\n- [#397](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/397) Improve docs for `.assert()`\n  By [@astorije](https://github.com/astorije)\n- [#401](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/401) Add some badges to the Readme.\n  By [@keithamus](https://github.com/keithamus)\n- [#424](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/424) Fix typo in docs for `.keys()`\n  By [@astorije](https://github.com/astorije)\n- [#429](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/429) Deprecate `.length(n)` from the docs - use `.lengthOf(n)` instead.\n  By [@valscion](https://github.com/valscion)\n- [#444](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/444) Change `.length(n)` examples to `.lengthOf(n)` instead.\n  By [@keithamus](https://github.com/keithamus)\n- [#458](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/458) Remove stray character in `assert.notInclude` docs\n  By [@BinaryMuse](https://github.com/BinaryMuse)\n"

Because of that, they were written to be used by terminating the assertion chain with a property access.\n\n``` js\nexpect(true).to.be.true;\nfoo.should.be.ok;\n```\n\nThis syntax is definitely aesthetically pleasing but, if you are linting your test code, your linter will complain with an error something like \"Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression.\" Since the linter doesn't know about the property getter it assumes this line has no side-effects, and throws a warning in case you made a mistake.\n\nSquelching these errors is not a good solution as test code is getting to be just as important as, if not more than, production code. Catching syntactical errors in tests using static analysis is a great tool to help make sure that your tests are well-defined and free of typos.\n\nA better option was to provide a function-call form for these assertions so that the code's intent is more clear and the linters stop complaining about something looking off. This form is added in addition to the existing property access form and does not impact existing test code.\n\n``` js\nexpect(true).to.be.true();\nfoo.should.be.ok();\n```\n\nThese forms can also be mixed in any way, these are all functionally identical:\n\n``` js\nexpect(true).to.be.true.and.not.false();\nexpect(true).to.be.true().and.not.false;\nexpect(true).to.be.true.and.not.false;\n```\n\n#### Plugin Authors\n\nIf you would like to provide this function-call form for your terminating assertion properties, there is a new function to register these types of asserts. Instead of using `addProperty` to register terminating assertions, simply use `addChainableNoop` instead; the arguments to both are identical. The latter will make the assertion available in both the attribute and function-call forms and should have no impact on existing users of your plugin.\n\n### Community Contributions\n- [#297](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/297) Allow writing lint-friendly tests.

(see notes)\n- **Plugin Developers:** \n  - No changes required\n- **Core Contributors:** \n  - Refresh `node_modules` folder for updated dependencies. \n\n### Configuration\n\nThere have been requests for changes and additions to the configuration mechanisms\nand their impact in the Chai architecture. As such, we have decoupled the \nconfiguration from the `Assertion` constructor. This not only allows for centralized\nconfiguration, but will allow us to shift the responsibility from the `Assertion` \nconstructor to the `assert` interface in future releases.\n\nThese changes have been implemented in a non-breaking way, but a depretiation\nwarning will be presented to users until they migrate. The old config method will \nbe removed in either `v1.11.0` or `v2.0.0`, whichever comes first.\n\n#### Quick Migration\n\n``` js\n// change this:\nchai.Assertion.includeStack = true;\nchai.Assertion.showDiff = false;\n\n// ... to this:\nchai.config.includeStack = true;\nchai.config.showDiff = false;\n```\n\n#### All Config Options\n\n##### config.includeStack\n- **@param** _{Boolean}_\n- **@default** `false`\n\nUser configurable property, influences whether stack trace is included in \nAssertion error message. Default of `false` suppresses stack trace in the error \nmessage.\n\n##### config.showDiff\n- **@param** _{Boolean}_\n- **@default** `true`\n\nUser configurable property, influences whether or not the `showDiff` flag \nshould be included in the thrown AssertionErrors. `false` will always be `false`; \n`true` will be true when the assertion has requested a diff be shown.\n\n##### config.truncateThreshold **(NEW)**\n- **@param** _{Number}_\n- **@default** `40`\n\nUser configurable property, sets length threshold for actual and expected values \nin assertion errors. If this threshold is exceeded, the value is truncated.\n\nSet it to zero if you want to disable truncating altogether.\n\n``` js\nchai.config.truncateThreshold = 0; // disable truncating\n```\n\n### Community Contributions\n- [#228](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/pull/228) Deep equality check for memebers.
